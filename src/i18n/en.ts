      `
        I am a developer with over 11 years of experience, starting my career in the game industry working with Unity3D and C#. Over time, I turned game development into a hobby and shifted my focus to software development, working as a Fullstack Developer with:

        Frontend: Angular and React

        Backend: .NET

        Databases: SQL Server, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB

        I have strong experience collaborating in Agile teams, contributing to high-quality deliveries, scalable architectures, and well-structured code.
        Driven by continuous learning, I enjoy building clean, efficient, and meaningful solutions.

        Nice to meet you — always open to new connections.
